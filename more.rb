# Write a function that takes in two arrays of numbers and returns all the numbers that appear in both arrays.

=begin
  - input: [1, 2], [3, 4]
    output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - create a function
  - make a new array variable
  - .each do - shovel in the components of the who arrays into the new array
      - might need two .each loops to get through all of that
  - return the new array
  else
  - create a function that takes in 2 arrays
  - create new array variable
  - shovel in both whole arrays into the array
  - return new array
=end
